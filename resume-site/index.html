			About Tommy Von Voigt
		</h1>
		<p>
			I recently graduated from a Front-End Web Development course at General Assembly where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, shred guitar, Xtreme tennis, that one thing Meatloaf refuses to do for love, and how to be an awesome Front-End Web Developer! During my spare time, I enjoy nothing. Nobody has spare time in NYC. Fool.
